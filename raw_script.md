Our script will be devided in 3 steps ( pages ) in this project i added all scripts for all serivices. 
Step 1 qualifying questions. 
Step 2 question based on services chosen. 
Step 3. Loading path, power, timing. 

On step 3 we need to ask questions based on the venue, location, and type of set up indoor or outdoor.

For hotels we need to know the instructions where should we go, who should we meet and where can we park to unloand and then after we finished with unloading. 

What is the room name or hall name, what is the booth number if applicable. 

If it is convention center do we need to go through martialing yard. If yes client need to provide us with details and connect with proper source. 

If it is a private residency do we need to go through security or pass code if yes we need to know. 

For loading is it an easy loading? do we need to go up on stairs if yes we need more details and mention that price might slightly increase and we might need more time for set up. 

If we choose service stage and we choose that stage will be outdoors we need to find out about surface and distance from parking to set up location. 

Power questions. 
We need to ask if location has power and how much power they have if they don't know we should ask to connect us with event space manager. If there is no power where we can place generators again we need to connect with location manager or client can provide us with details. 

Timelines. 
Does client have schedule and run of the show? 
By what time we need to be done with set up. What time we need to start strike. What time show starts and when lead technicians must be ready. If it is a full day event what time are breaks if they have it. 
Do they need to do a rehearsal if yes we need to know timing.

Basicly the goal of our dynamic script is based on repsonses from the begining if we answered them already we need to add answer to other areas and based on this answers we need to pop up additional questions. 

Now i need to make a final version that i can pass to web development team to make me a dynamic questionary that will have 3 pages. With buttons next and back at the end of each page and qualify button that sales will have to press and choose qualified lead or not. If not they will have to explain why and then submit. 

This dynamic questionary should pop up questions based on the answers that was choosen and at the end based on the asnwers i will need to generate pdf with answers only and all questions that wasn't answered we don't need to show.
